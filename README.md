# Matrix_Multiplication
Multithreading

There is a file that contains the names of the other 5 files. In each of these 5 files, 2 matrices 3x2 are recorded. 
You need to multiply these matrices with each other and write the result to a new file, and save all the files to a zip archive (everything should happen inmemory). 
For each file - a separate stream. 
Threads should work parallel to each other.
